## Running the Playground

To test the BAML playground in VSCode:

1. First, open the `root-wasm32.code-workspace` file in VSCode
2. Press F5 or use the Run and Debug view
3. Select "Launch VS Code extension" from the debug configurations
4. A new VSCode window will open with the BAML extension running in development mode

You can also run both the VSCode extension and Language Server together by:
1. Using the Run and Debug view
2. Selecting "VS Code + Language Server" from the debug configurations

This will launch both the extension and attach the debugger to the language server.

> **Note**: Opening the workspace file is important as it contains the necessary VSCode settings and recommended extensions for development.
