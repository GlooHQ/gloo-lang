BAML lets you stream in structured JSON output from LLMs as it comes in.

If you tried streaming in a JSON output from an LLM you'd see something like:
```
{"items": [{"name": "Appl
{"items": [{"name": "Apple", "quantity": 2, "price": 1.
{"items": [{"name": "Apple", "quantity": 2, "price": 1.50}], "total_cost":
{"items": [{"name": "Apple", "quantity": 2, "price": 1.50}], "total_cost": 3.00} # Completed
```

BAML gives you fine-grained control of how it fixes this partial JSON and transforms
it into a series of semantically valid partial objects.

<Tip>You can check out more examples (including streaming in FastAPI and NextJS) in the [BAML Examples] repo.</Tip>

Let's stream the output of this function `function ExtractReceiptInfo(email: string) -> ReceiptInfo` for our example:

<Accordion title="extract-receipt-info.baml">

```rust
class ReceiptItem {
  name string
  description string?
  quantity int
  price float
}

class ReceiptInfo {
    items ReceiptItem[]
    total_cost float?
}

function ExtractReceiptInfo(email: string) -> ReceiptInfo {
  client GPT4o
  prompt #"
    Given the receipt below:

    {{ email }}

    {{ ctx.output_format }}
  "#
}
```
</Accordion>

The BAML code generator creates a set of types in the `baml_client` library
in a module called `partial_types` in `baml_client`. These types are modified
from your original types to support streaming.

By default, BAML will convert all Class fields into nullable fields, and
fill those fields with non-null values as much as possible given the tokens
received so far.

BAML will generate `b.stream.ExtractReceiptInfo()` for you, which you can use like so:

```python main.py
import asyncio
from baml_client import b, partial_types, types

# Using a stream:
def example1(receipt: str):
    stream = b.stream.ExtractReceiptInfo(receipt)

    # partial is a Partial type with all Optional fields
    for partial in stream:
        print(f"partial: parsed {len(partial.items)} items (object: {partial})")

    # final is the full, original, validated ReceiptInfo type
    final = stream.get_final_response()
    print(f"final: {len(final.items)} items (object: {final})")

# Using only get_final_response() of a stream
#
# In this case, you should just use b.ExtractReceiptInfo(receipt) instead,
# which is slightly faster and more efficient.
def example2(receipt: str):
    final = b.stream.ExtractReceiptInfo(receipt).get_final_response()
    print(f"final: {len(final.items)} items (object: {final})")

# Using the async client:
async def example3(receipt: str):
    # Note the import of the async client
    from baml_client.async_client import b
    stream = b.stream.ExtractReceiptInfo(receipt)
    async for partial in stream:
        print(f"partial: parsed {len(partial.items)} items (object: {partial})")

    final = await stream.get_final_response()
    print(f"final: {len(final.items)} items (object: {final})")

Streaming is not yet supported via OpenAPI, but it will be coming soon!

</Tabs>

<Note>
Number fields are always streamed in only when the LLM completes them. E.g. if
the final number is 129.95, you'll only see null or 129.95 instead of partial
numbers like 1, 12, 129.9, etc.
</Note>

## Semantic Streaming

BAML provides powerful attributes to control how your data streams, ensuring that partial values always maintain semantic validity. Here are the three key streaming attributes:

### `@stream.done`
This attribute ensures a type or field is only streamed when it's completely finished. It's useful when you need atomic, fully-formed values.

For example:
```baml
class ReceiptItem {
  name string
  quantity int
  price float

  // The entire ReceiptItem will only stream when complete
  @@stream.done
}

// Receipts is a list of ReceiptItems,
// each internal item will only stream when complete
type Receipts = ReceiptItem[]

class Person {
  // Name will only appear when fully complete,
  // until then it will be null
  name string @stream.done     
  // Numbers (floats and ints) will only appear
  // when fully complete by default
  age int                     
  // Bio will stream token by token
  bio string                  
}
```

### `@stream.not_null`
This attribute ensures a containing object is only streamed when this field has a value. It's particularly useful for discriminator fields or required metadata.

For example:
```baml
class Message {
  // Message won't stream until type is known
  type "error" | "success" | "info" @stream.not_null
  // Timestamp will only appear when fully complete
  // until then it will be null
  timestamp string @stream.done                       
  // Content can stream token by token
  content string                                      
}
```

### `@stream.with_state`
This attribute adds metadata to track if a field has finished streaming. It's perfect for showing loading states in UIs.

For example:
```baml
class BlogPost {
  // The blog post will only stream when title is known
  title string @stream.done @stream.not_null
  // The content will stream token by token, and include completion state
  content string @stream.with_state 
}
```

This will generate the following code in the `partial_types` module:
<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">
```python
class StreamState(BaseModel, Generic[T]):
  value: T,
  state: "incomplete" | "complete"

class BlogPost(BaseModel):
  title: str
  content: StreamState[str | None]
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Typescript">
```typescript
interface StreamState<T> {
  value: T,
  state: "incomplete" | "complete"
}

interface BlogPost {
  title: StreamState<string>
  content: StreamState<string>
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Type Transformation Summary

Here's how these attributes affect your types in generated code:

| BAML Type                         | Generated Type (during streaming)              | Description                                    |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `T`                               | `Partial[T]?`              | Default: Nullable and partial                   |
| `T @stream.done`                  | `T?`                       | Nullable but always complete when present       |
| `T @stream.not_null`              | `Partial[T]`               | Always present but may be partial              |
| `T @stream.done @stream.not_null` | `T`                        | Always present and always complete             |
| `T @stream.with_state`            | `StreamState[Partial[T]?]` | Includes streaming state metadata              |

<Warning>
The return type of a function is not affected by streaming attributes!
</Warning>

## Putting it all together

Let's put all of these concepts together to design an application that
streams a conversation containing stock recommendations, using semantic
streaming to ensure that the streamed data obeys our domain's invariants.

```baml
enum Stock {
  APPL
  MSFT
  GOOG
  BAML
}

// Make recommendations atomic - we do not want a recommendation to be
// modified by streaming additional messages.
class Recommendation {
  stock Stock
  amount float
  action "buy" | "sell"
  @@stream.done
}

class AssistantMessage {
  message_type "greeting" | "conversation" | "farewell" @stream.not_null
  message string @stream.with_state @stream.not_null
}

function Respond(
  history: (UserMessage | AssistantMessage | Recommendation)[]
) -> Message | Recommendation { 
  client DeepseekR1
  prompt #"
    Make the message in the conversation, using a conversational
    message or a stock recommendation, based on this conversation history:
    {{ history }}.

    {{ ctx.output_format }}
  "#
}
```

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Python">
The above BAML code will generate the following Python definitions in the
`partial_types` module. The use of streaming attributes has several effects on
the generated code:

 - `Recommendation` does not have any partial fields because it was marked
   `@stream.done`.
 - The `Message.message` `string` is wrapped in `StreamState`, allowing
   runtime checking of its completion status. This status could be used
   to render a spinner as the message streams in.
 - The `Message.message_type` field may not be `null`, because it was marked
   as `@stream.not_null`.

```python
class StreamState(BaseModel, Generic[T]):
  value: T,
  state: Literal["Incomplete", "Complete"]

class Stock(str, Enum):
    APPL = "APPL"
    MSFT = "MSFT"
    GOOG = "GOOG"
    BAML = "BAML"

class Recommendation(BaseClass):
    stock: Stock
    amount: float
    action: Literal["buy", "sell"]

class Message(BaseClass):
  message_type: Literal["gretting","conversation","farewell"]
  message: StreamState[string]
```
