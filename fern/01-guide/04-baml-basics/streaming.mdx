BAML lets you stream in structured JSON output from LLMs as it comes in.

If you tried streaming in a JSON output from an LLM you'd see something like:
```
{"items": [{"name": "Appl
{"items": [{"name": "Apple", "quantity": 2, "price": 1.
{"items": [{"name": "Apple", "quantity": 2, "price": 1.50}], "total_cost":
{"items": [{"name": "Apple", "quantity": 2, "price": 1.50}], "total_cost": 3.00} # Completed
```

BAML gives you fine-grained control of how it fixes this partial JSON and transforms
it into a series of semantically valid partial objects.

<Tip>You can check out more examples (including streaming in FastAPI and NextJS) in the [BAML Examples] repo.</Tip>

Let's stream the output of this function `function ExtractReceiptInfo(email: string) -> ReceiptInfo` for our example:

<Accordion title="extract-receipt-info.baml">

```rust
class ReceiptItem {
  name string
  description string?
  quantity int
  price float
}

class ReceiptInfo {
    items ReceiptItem[]
    total_cost float?
}

function ExtractReceiptInfo(email: string) -> ReceiptInfo {
  client GPT4o
  prompt #"
    Given the receipt below:

    {{ email }}

    {{ ctx.output_format }}
  "#
}
```
</Accordion>

The BAML code generator creates a set of types in the `baml_client` library
in a module called `partial_types` in `baml_client`. These types are modified
from your original types to support streaming.

By default, BAML will convert all Class fields into nullable fields, and
fill those fields with non-null values as much as possible given the tokens
received so far.

    # final is the full, original, validated ReceiptInfo type
    final = stream.get_final_response()
    print(f"final: {len(final.items)} items (object: {final})")

# Using only get_final_response() of a stream

# In this case, you should just use b.ExtractReceiptInfo(receipt) instead,
# which is slightly faster and more efficient.

<Note>
Number fields are always streamed in only when the LLM completes them. E.g. if
the final number is 129.95, you'll only see null or 129.95 instead of partial
numbers like 1, 12, 129.9, etc.
</Note>

## Semantic Streaming

Sometimes you will want streaming to behave differently from the behavior
described above for `Partial` types.

BAML provides several attributes that can be attached to types
to control streaming behavior, ensuring that the partial values streamed to you
are always valid within your own semantics.

  - `@stream.done`: Marks a type that should only be streamed when it is
    done being read from the LLM response.
  - `@stream.not_null`: Indicates that the class containing
     that field should only be streamed if that field is present.
  - `@stream.with_state`: Adds metadata to a type indicating whether is has
    finished streaming or not.

This table summarizes how the attributes impact types your will consume from
streaming clients:

| BAML type                         | Generated type             |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `T`                               | `Partial[T]?`              |
| `T @stream.done`                  | `T?`                       |
| `T @stream.not_null`              | `Partial[T]`               |
| `T @stream.done @stream.not_null` | `T`                        |
| `T @stream.with_state`            | `StreamState[Partial[T]?]` |

    
### `@stream.done`

To demonstrate the use of `@stream.done`, imagine that a `ReceiptItem`
must only be considered valid and can only reach the client when its `name`,
`description`, `quantity` and `price` fields are completely streamed in.
To achieve this we can annotate the `ReceiptItem` class with the
`@stream.done` attribute:

```rust
class ReceiptItem {
  name string
  description string?
  quantity int
  price float
  @@stream.done // <-- This annotation make ReceiptItem non-streaming.
}
```

When generating the client code for `ReceiptType` none of the fields of
`ReceiptItem` will be Optional or Partial. And when parsing an LLM response,
no `ReceiptItem` will be streamed ot you until all of its fields are done being
streamed in.

```rust
class Person {
  name string @stream.done
  phone_number string @stream.done
  description string
}
```

When using `@stream.done` on fields, the fields will never be partially filled,
although they may be `null`. This `Person` will be streamed to your client one
piece at a time, and the `description` will be streamed one token at a time.
However, you will never see a partial `name` or a partial `phone_number` - these
values will be delivered atomically.

### `@stream.not_null`

Sometimes the presence of a value is important to the correct interpretation
of a containing value. This commonly occurs with tags used to determine which
variant of a union is being used.

For example, in this code, `@stream.not_null` on each of the
`message_type` fields will ensure that an `Event` is never streamed until
enough tokens have been received to know precisely what the message type is,
allowing you to build UI appropriate to the message type before the other
fields have been completed.

```rust
class Message {
  message_type "greeting" | "within-convo" | "farewell" @stream.not_null
  gesture ("gesticulate" | "wave" | "shake-hands" | "hug")
  message string
}

class Event {
  speaker string @stream.done
  event_message: Message
}

function Chat(history: Event[]) -> Event { ... }
```

<Tip>
You might wonder if it's sufficient to use `@stream.done` on the
`message_type` field. `@stream.done` applies to types, preventing them
from streaming out until they are completed. On the other hand,
`@stream.not_null` applies to fields and prevents a containing object
from streaming out until that field is present. `@stream.not_null` is more
appropriate here so that your client will never see a `Message` until
there is enough information (the `message_type` field) to begin to render
it.

A type with `@stream.done` will still be converted to a
nullable field in the generated partial types, and would not
produce the desired result of witholding a `Message` until its type is
known. Messages would be streamed with `message_type: null`.

This is a subtle distinction between `@stream.done` and
`@stream.not_null`. As a rule of thumb, remember that `@stream.done`
is about the type itself, and `@stream.not_null` is about the type's
containing context.
</Tip>

### `@stream.with_state`

It is often useful to know whether a value is finished, or
could be updated in future messages. For example, in a frontend,
you could use this information to render a spinner on data that are
still streaming. The `@stream.with_state` attribute lets
you attach metadata to types to indicate this state in client code.

## Putting it all together

Let's put all of these concepts together to design an application that
streams a conversation containing stock recommendations, using semantic
streaming to ensure that the streamed data obeys our domain's invariants.

```rust
enum Stock {
  APPL,
  MSFT,
  GOOG,
  BAML,
}

// Make recommendations atomic - we do not want a recommendation to be
// modified by streaming additional messages.
class Recommendation {
  stock Stock
  amount float
  action "buy" | "sell"
  @@stream.done
}

class AssistantMessage {
  message_type "greeting" | "conversation" | "farewell" @stream.not_null
  message string @stream.with_state @stream.not_null
}

function Respond(
  history: (UserMessage | AssistantMessage | Recommendation)[]
) -> Message | Recommendation { 
  client DeepseekR1
  prompt #"
    Make the message in the conversation, using a conversational
    message or a stock recommendation, based on this conversation history:
    {{ history }}.

    {{ ctx.output_format }}
  "#
}
```

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Python">
The above BAML code will generate the following Python definitions in the
`partial_types` module. The use of streaming attributes has several effects on
the generated code:

 - `Recommendation` does not have any partial fields because it was marked
   `@stream.done`.
 - The `Message.message` `string` is wrapped in `StreamState`, allowing
   runtime checking of its completion status. This status could be used
   to render a spinner as the message streams in.
 - The `Message.message_type` field may not be `null`, because it was marked
   as `@stream.not_null`.

```python
class StreamState(BaseModel, Generic[T]):
  value: T,
  state: Literal["Incomplete", "Complete"]

class Stock(str, Enum):
    APPL = "APPL"
    MSFT = "MSFT"
    GOOG = "GOOG"
    BAML = "BAML"

class Recommendation(BaseClass):
    stock: Stock
    amount: float
