title: Next.js Integration Overview
---

BAML provides first-class support for Next.js, allowing you to seamlessly integrate AI capabilities into your Next.js applications. This integration supports both the App Router and Pages Router, with built-in features for streaming responses, type safety, and efficient state management.

## Key Features

- **Full App Router Support**: Native support for React Server Components and Server Actions
- **Pages Router Compatibility**: Support for traditional Next.js routing with API Routes
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time streaming of LLM responses to your UI
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with automatic type generation
- **State Management**: Built-in hooks for managing streaming state
- **Environment Management**: Seamless handling of environment variables
- **Production Ready**: Optimized for production deployments

## Getting Started

The fastest way to get started is to use our Next.js starter template:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BoundaryML/baml-examples.git
cd baml-examples/nextjs-starter
```

Or check out our [live demo](https://baml-examples.vercel.app/) to see it in action.

## Choose Your Setup

BAML supports two main approaches for Next.js integration:

1. **App Router (Recommended)**
   - Uses React Server Components
   - Leverages Server Actions for API calls
   - Provides better performance and SEO
   - [Get started with App Router →](./nextjs-app-router)

2. **Pages Router**
   - Uses traditional API Routes
   - Familiar routing system
   - Compatible with older Next.js projects
   - [Get started with Pages Router →](./nextjs-pages-router)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Node.js 16.8 or later
- Next.js 13 or later
- TypeScript (recommended)
- BAML CLI and VSCode/Cursor extension installed

## Next Steps

1. Choose your router architecture and follow the setup guide:
   - [App Router Setup](./nextjs-app-router)
   - [Pages Router Setup](./nextjs-pages-router)

2. Learn about streaming responses:
   - [Streaming Guide](./nextjs-streaming)

3. Configure your environment:
   - [Environment Setup](./nextjs-environment)

4. Deploy your application:

<Note>
For the best development experience, we recommend using the App Router with Server Actions. This provides the most seamless integration with BAML's streaming capabilities.
