Refer to the [Cursor Extension Installation Guide](https://www.cursor.com/how-to-install-extension) to install the extension in Cursor.

<Warning>
You may need to update BAML extension manually using the process above. Auto-update does not seem to be working well for many extensions in Cursor.
</Warning>

### Cursor Rules to write BAML
We created a [.cursorrules file for BAML](https://gist.github.com/aaronvg/b4f590f59b13dcfd79721239128ec208), to aid Cursor in writing BAML prompts. Feel free to edit this however you like!
