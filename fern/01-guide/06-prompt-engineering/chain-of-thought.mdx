title: Chain-of-Thought Prompting
---

Chain-of-thought prompting is a technique that asdf encourages the language model to think step by step, reasoning through the problem before providing an answer. This can improve the quality of the response and make it easier to understand.

There are a few different ways to implement chain-of-thought prompting, especially for structured outputs.

1. Require the model to reason before outputting the structured object.
    - Bonus: Use a `template_string` to embed the reasoning into multiple functions.
2. Require the model to **flexibly** reason before outputting the structured object.
3. Embed reasoning in the structured object.
4. Ask the model to embed reasoning as comments in the structured object.

Let's look at an example of each of these.

<Tip>
  We recommend [Technique 2](#technique-2-allowing-for-flexible-reasoning) for most use cases.
  But each technique has its own trade-offs, so please try them out and see which one works best for your use case.
</Tip>

<Info>
  Since BAML leverages [Schema-Aligned Parsing (SAP)](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/schema-aligned-parsing) instead of JSON.parse or LLM modification (like constrained generation or structured outputs), we can do all of the above techniques with any language model!

## Technique 1: Reasoning before outputting the structured object

In the below example, we use chain of thought prompting to extract information from an email.

```baml {9-17}
function GetOrderInfo(email: Email) -> OrderInfo {
  client "openai/gpt-4o-mini"
  prompt #"
    extract everything from this email.


    {{ ctx.output_format }}

    Before you answer, please explain your reasoning step-by-step. 
    
    For example:
    If we think step by step we can see that ...

    Therefore the output is:
    {
      ... // schema
    }

    {{ _.role('user') }}

    Sender: {{email.from_address}}
    Email Subject: {{email.subject}}
    Email Body: {{email.body}}
  "#
}

class Email {
    subject string
    body string
    from_address string
}


class OrderInfo {
    order_status "ORDERED" | "SHIPPED" | "DELIVERED" | "CANCELLED"
    tracking_number string?
    estimated_arrival_date string?
}

test Test1 {
  functions [GetOrderInfo]
  args {
    email {
      from_address "hello@amazon.com"
      subject "Your Amazon.com order of 'Wood Dowel Rods...' has shipped!"
      body #"
        Hi Sam, your package will arrive:
        Thurs, April 4
        Track your package:
        www.amazon.com/gp/your-account/ship-track?ie=23&orderId123

        On the way:
        Wood Dowel Rods...
        Order #113-7540940
        Ship to:
            Sam
            SEATTLE, WA

        Shipment total:
        $0.00
    "#

    }
  }
}
```


### Reusable Chain-of-Thought Snippets

You may want to reuse the same technique for multiple functions. Consider [template_string](/ref/baml/template-string)!

```baml {1-12, 21}
template_string ChainOfThought(action: string?) #"
    Before you answer, please explain your reasoning step-by-step.
    {% if action %}{{ action }}{% endif %}
    
    For example:
    If we think step by step we can see that ...

    Therefore the output is:
    {
      ... // schema
    }
"#

function GetOrderInfo(email: Email) -> OrderInfo {
  client "openai/gpt-"
  prompt #"
    Extract everything from this email.

    {{ ctx.output_format }}

    {{ ChainOfThought("focus on things related to shipping") }}

    {{ _.role('user') }}

    Sender: {{email.from_address}}
    Email Subject: {{email.subject}}
    Email Body: {{email.body}}
  "#
}

```

## Technique 2: Allowing for flexible reasoning

<Tip>
  This is one we recommend for most use cases.
</Tip>

```baml {9-16}
function GetOrderInfo(email: Email) -> OrderInfo {
  client "openai/gpt-"
  prompt #"
    extract everything from this email.


    {{ ctx.output_format }}

    Outline some relevant information before you answer.
    Example:
    - ...
    - ...
    ...
    {
      ... // schema
    }

    {{ _.role('user') }}

    Sender: {{email.from_address}}
    Email Subject: {{email.subject}}
    Email Body: {{email.body}}
  "#
}
```

The benefit of using `- ...` is that we allow the model to know it needs to output some information, but we don't limit it to a specific format or inject any bias by adding example text that may not be relevant.

Similarly, we use `...` after two `- ...` to indicate that we don't mean to limit the number of items to 2.

```baml {1-10, 19}

    Outline some relevant information before you answer.
    Example:
    - ...
    - ...
    ...
    {
      ... // schema
    }
"#

function GetOrderInfo(email: Email) -> OrderInfo {
  client "openai/gpt-"
  prompt #"
    extract everything from this email.

    {{ ctx.output_format }}

    {{ ChainOfThought() }}

    {{ _.role('user') }}

    Sender: {{email.from_address}}
    Email Subject: {{email.subject}}
    Email Body: {{email.body}}
  "#
}
```
</Accordion>

## Technique 3: Embed reasoning in the structured object

```baml {2-4}
class OrderInfo {
    clues string[] @description(#"
      relevant quotes from the email related to shipping
    "#)
    order_status "ORDERED" | "SHIPPED" | "DELIVERED" | "CANCELLED"
    tracking_number string?
    estimated_arrival_date string?
}

function GetOrderInfo(email: Email) -> OrderInfo {
  client "openai/gpt-"
  prompt #"
    extract everything from this email.

    {{ ctx.output_format }}

    {{ _.role('user') }}

    Sender: {{email.from_address}}
    Email Subject: {{email.subject}}
    Email Body: {{email.body}}
  "#
}
```

## Technique 4: Ask the model to embed reasoning as comments in the structured object

```baml {3-5}
class OrderInfo {
    order_status "ORDERED" | "SHIPPED" | "DELIVERED" | "CANCELLED"
      @description(#"
        before fields, in comments list out any relevant clues from the email
      "#)
    tracking_number string?
    estimated_arrival_date string?
}

function GetOrderInfo(email: Email) -> OrderInfo {
  client "openai/gpt-"
  prompt #"
    extract everything from this email.

    {{ ctx.output_format }}

    {{ _.role('user') }}

    Sender: {{email.from_address}}
    Email Subject: {{email.subject}}
    Email Body: {{email.body}}
  "#
}
```
