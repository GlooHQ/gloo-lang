The `vertex-ai` provider is used to interact with the Google Vertex AI services.

<Warning>
  `vertex-ai` support for Anthropic models is coming soon.
</Warning>


Example: 
```baml BAML
client<llm> MyClient {
  provider vertex-ai
  options {
    model gemini-1.5-pro
    location us-central1
  }
}
```

## Authentication

The `vertex-ai` provider by default will try to authenticate using the following strategies:

- if `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` is set, it will use the specified service account
- if you have run `gcloud auth application-default login`, it will use those credentials
- if running in GCP, it will query the metadata server to use the attached service account
- if `gcloud` is available on the `PATH`, it will use `gcloud auth print-access-token`

If you're using Google Cloud [application default
credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials), you
can expect authentication to work out of the box.

Setting [`options.credentials`](#credentials) will take precedence and force `vertex-ai` to load
service account credentials from that file path.

Setting [`options.credentials_content`](#credentials_content) will also take precedence and force
`vertex-ai` to load service account credentials from that string.

<Accordion title='Using a `vertex-ai` client in the playground'>

To use a `vertex-ai` client in the playground, you'll need to create service account credentials.

1. Go to [IAM & Admin > Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) in the Google Cloud Console.
2. Choose the project you want to use.
5. Select an existing service account or create a new one.
6. Click on the service account, navigate to the `Keys` tab, select `Add Key`, and select `Create new key`.
7. Confirm that the key type will be `JSON` and click `Create`.
1. Copy the contents of the downloaded JSON key.
1. Open the BAML playground, and click `API Keys` in the top right.
9. Paste the JSON key into the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` field.

You should now be able to use a `vertex-ai` client in the playground!

## Debugging

<Accordion title='Authentication'>

If you're having issues with `vertex-ai` authentication, you can try setting `BAML_LOG=debug` to see more detailed logs.

To understand these logs, it'll help to understand the auth implementation of the `vertex-ai` provider.

The `vertex-ai` provider uses one of 3 strategies to authenticate with Google Cloud:

- `AuthStrategy::JsonString(value: String)` - parse `value` as a JSON
  object, and use that to resolve a service account
- `AuthStrategy::JsonFile(path: String)` - read the file at `path` (relative to
  the process' current working directory), parse it as a JSON object, and use that
  to resolve a service account
- `AuthStrategy::SystemDefault` - try 3 strategies in order:
    - resolve credentials from `.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`; else
    - use the service account from the GCP compute environment by querying the metadata server; else
    - check if `gcloud` is available on the `PATH` and if so, use `gcloud auth print-access-token`

We choose one of the three strategies based on the following rules, in order:

1. Is `credentials` provided?
     - If so, and it's a string containing a JSON object, we use `AuthStrategy::JsonFile` with `credentials`.
     - If so, and it's a JSON object, we use `AuthStrategy::JsonObject` with `credentials` (this is probably only
       relevant if you're using the [`ClientRegistry`](/ref/baml-client/client-registry) API in `baml_client`).
     - If so, but it's just a regular string, use `AuthStrategy::JsonFile` with `credentials`.
1. Is `credentials_content` provided?
     - If so, we use `AuthStrategy::JsonString` with `credentials_content`
1. Is `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` set?
     - If so, and it looks like a JSON object, we use `AuthStrategy::JsonString` with `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
     - If so, but it's just a regular string, use `AuthStrategy::JsonFile` with `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
1. Is `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_CONTENT` set?
     - If so, we use `AuthStrategy::JsonString` with `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_CONTENT`
1. Else, we use `AuthStrategy::SystemDefault`

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Request protocol'>

We use the REST API to send requests to Vertex AI, and you can debug these using
the BAML playground and switch from showing "Prompt Preview" to "Raw cURL", which
will show you the exact request the BAML runtime will construct and send.

Non-streaming requests will use `{base_url}:generateContent`:
```
https://${LOCATION}-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/${LOCATION}/publishers/google/models/${MODEL_ID}:generateContent
```

Streaming requests will use `{base_url}:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse`:
```
https://${LOCATION}-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/${LOCATION}/publishers/google/models/${MODEL_ID}:streamGenerateContent
```

</Accordion>

## BAML-specific request `options`
These unique parameters (aka `options`) modify the API request sent to the provider.

You can use this to modify the `headers` and `base_url` for example.

<ParamField path="base_url" type="string">
  The base URL for the API.

  **Default**: inferred from the `project_id` and `location` using the following format:
  
  ```
  https://{LOCATION}-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/{LOCATION}/publishers/google/models/
  ```

  Can be used in lieu of the **`project_id`** and **`location`** fields, to manually set the request URL.
</ParamField>


<ParamField
  path="project_id"
  type="string"
>
  The Google Cloud project ID hosting the Vertex AI service you want to call.

  **Default**: inferred from the provided credentials (see [`Authentication`](#authentication)).
</ParamField>

{/*The anchor is placed above "location" and not "credentials" because this will ensure that "credentials" is
visible on-screen when the user navigates to #credentials, due to how Fern renders its HTML layout.*/}

<a name="credentials"></a>

<ParamField
  path="location"
  type="string"
  required
>
  Vertex requires you to specify the location you want to serve your models
  from. Some models may only be available in certain locations.
  
  Common locations include:
  - `us-central1`
  - `us-west1`
  - `us-east1`
  - `us-south1`

  See the [Vertex AI docs](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/locations#united-states)
  for all locations and supported models.

</ParamField>

{/*The anchor is placed above "credentials" and not "credentials_content" because this will ensure that "credentials_content" is
visible on-screen when the user navigates to #credentials_content, due to how Fern renders its HTML layout.*/}

<a name="credentials_content"></a>

<ParamField
  path="credentials"
  type="string | object"
>

  This field supports any of 3 formats:

    - A string containing service account credentials in JSON format.
    - Path to a file containing service account credentials in JSON format.
    - A JSON object containing service account credentials.

  See [Authentication](#authentication) and [Debugging](#debugging) for more information.

  **Default: `env.GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`**

## Provider request parameters
These are other parameters that are passed through to the provider, without modification by BAML. For example if the request has a `temperature` field, you can define it in the client here so every call has that set.

Consult the specific provider's documentation for more information.
<ParamField
  path="safetySettings"
  type="object"
>
  Safety settings to apply to the request. You can stack different safety settings with a new `safetySettings` header for each one. See the [Google Vertex API Request Docs](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) for more information on what safety settings can be set.

```baml BAML
client<llm> MyClient {
  provider vertex-ai
  options {
    model gemini-1.5-pro
    project_id my-project-id
    location us-central1

    safetySettings {
      category HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH
      threshold BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE
      method SEVERITY
    }
  }
}
```
</ParamField>

<ParamField
  path="generationConfig"
  type="object"
>
  Generation configurations to apply to the request. See the [Google Vertex API Request Docs](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) for more information on what properties can be set.
```baml BAML
client<llm> MyClient {
  provider vertex-ai
  options {
    model gemini-1.5-pro
    project_id my-project-id
    location us-central1
    
    generationConfig {
      maxOutputTokens 100
      temperature 1
    }
  }
}
```
   
</ParamField>

For all other options, see the [official Vertex AI documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/quickstart-multimodal).

## Publishers Other Than Google

If you are using models from publishers other than Google, such as Llama from
Meta, use your project endpoint as the `base_url` in BAML:

```baml
client<llm> VertexLlama {
  provider vertex-ai
  options {  
    base_url "https://${LOCATION}-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/${LOCATION}/endpoints/"
    location us-central1
  }
}
```
