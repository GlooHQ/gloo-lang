The `@stream.not_null` attribute ensures a containing object is only streamed when
the marked field has a value. This is particularly useful for discriminator fields
or required metadata where the presence of certain fields is essential for the
object to be meaningful.

## Streaming Impact

### Without `@stream.not_null`

```baml BAML
class Message {
  type "error" | "success"
  content string
}
```

During streaming, the object will stream even when the type is unknown:
```json
{"type": null, "content": "An error occurred"}
{"type": "error", "content": "An error occurred"}
```

### With `@stream.not_null`

```baml BAML
class Message {
  type "error" | "success" @stream.not_null
  content string
}
```

The object will only stream once the type field has a value:
```json
{"type": "error", "content": "An"}
{"type": "error", "content": "An error"}
{"type": "error", "content": "An error occurred"}
```

## Common Use Cases

- Ensuring discriminator fields are present before streaming.
- Guaranteeing critical metadata is available.
- Maintaining data validity in streaming responses.
- Working with fields that are required for type identification.

## Type Transformation

When using `@stream.not_null`, the type transformation in generated code is:
- Regular type `T` becomes `Partial[T]` (always present but may be partial).
- When combined with `@stream.done`, type `T` becomes `T` (always present and complete).

## Combining with Other Streaming Attributes

`@stream.not_null` can be combined with other streaming attributes for fine-grained control:

```baml BAML
class BlogPost {
  // The blog post will only stream when title is known and complete.
  title string @stream.done @stream.not_null
  // Content will stream token by token.
  content string
}
```
