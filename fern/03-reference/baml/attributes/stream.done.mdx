The `@stream.done` attribute changes the streaming behavior of a type.

## Streaming Impact

### Without `@stream.done`

```baml BAML
class Person {
  name string
  age int
}
```

During streaming, fields will be populated as they come in:
```json
{"name": "Jo"}
{"name": "John", "age": null}
{"name": "John Smith", "age": 30}
```

### With `@stream.done`

```baml BAML
class Person {
  name string @stream.done
  age int
}
```

The name field will only appear when fully complete:
```json
{"name": null, "age": null}
{"name": "John Smith", "age": null}
{"name": "John Smith", "age": 30}
```

You can also apply it to an entire class:

```baml BAML
class Person {
  name string
  age int
  @@stream.done
}
```

In this case, the entire Person object will only stream when all fields are complete.

## Common Use Cases

- Ensuring atomic values for critical fields like IDs or status codes.
- Preventing partial or incomplete data from being processed or rendered.
- Maintaining data consistency in streaming responses.
- Working with fields that only make sense when fully formed.

## Type Transformation

When using `@stream.done`, the type transformation in generated code is:
- Regular type `T` becomes `T?` (nullable but always complete when present)
- When combined with `@stream.not_null`, type `T` becomes `T` (always present and complete)
