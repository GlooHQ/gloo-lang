The `@skip` attribute in BAML is used to exclude certain fields or values from being included in prompts or parsed responses. This can be useful when certain data is not relevant for the LLM's processing.

## Prompt Impact

### Without `@skip`

```baml BAML
enum MyEnum {
  Value1
  Value2
}
```

**ctx.output_format:**

```
MyEnum
---
Value1
Value2
```

### With `@skip`

```baml BAML
enum MyEnum {
  Value1
  Value2 @skip
}
```

**ctx.output_format:**

```
MyEnum
---
Value1
```
