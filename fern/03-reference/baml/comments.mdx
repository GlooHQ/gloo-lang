## Single line / trailing comments

Denoted by `//`.

```baml
// hello there!
foo // this is a trailing comment
```

## Docstrings

To add a docstring to any block, use `///`.

```baml
/// This is a docstring for a class
class Foo {
    /// This is a docstring for a property
    property1 string
}
```

Docstrings in BAML code will be carried through to generated types.
They are not forwarded to the LLM through prompts.

{/* ## Multiline comments

Multiline comments are denoted via `{//` and `//}`.

```baml
{//
    this is a multiline comment
    foo
    bar
//}
``` */}
