Each `generator` that you define in your BAML project will tell `baml-cli
generate` to generate code for a specific target language. You can define
multiple `generator` clauses in your BAML project, and `baml-cli generate` will
generate code for each of them.

<Tip>If you created your project using `baml-cli init`, then one has already been generated for you!</Tip>
